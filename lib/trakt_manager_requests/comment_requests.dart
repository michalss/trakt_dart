/// Comments are attached to any movie, show, season, episode, or list and can be a quick shout or a more detailed review.
/// Each comment can have replies and can be liked. These likes are used to determine popular comments.
/// Comments must follow these rules and your app should indicate these to the user.
/// Failure to adhere to these rules could suspend the user's commenting abilities.
///
/// - Comments must be at least 5 words.
///
/// - Comments 200 words or longer will be automatically marked as a review.
///
/// - Correctly indicate if the comment contains spoilers.Only write comments in English - This is important!
///
/// - Do not include app specific text like (via App Name) or #apphashtag.
/// This clutters up the comments and failure to clean the comment text could get your app blacklisted from commenting.
///
/// Validation Errors
///
/// If a comment doesn't pass validation, it returns a 422 HTTP error code and an array of validation errors in the response.
/// The validation errors could include: "must be at least 5 words" or "must be written in English"
///
/// Comment Formatting
///
/// Comments support markdown formatting so you'll want to render this in your app so it matches what the website does.
/// In addition, we support inline spoiler tags like [spoiler]text[/spoiler] which you should also handle independent of the top level spoiler attribute.
